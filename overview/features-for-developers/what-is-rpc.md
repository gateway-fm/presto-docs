# What Is RPC

To interact with the Presto L2 blockchain, developers can use JSON-RPC (Remote Procedure Call), a protocol for making remote procedure calls using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) over HTTP or other transport protocols. JSON-RPC allows developers to send requests to the Presto L2 network and receive responses, enabling them to read data from the blockchain, send transactions, and execute smart contracts.

Blockchain JSON-RPC offers a comprehensive set of methods and APIs that allow developers to seamlessly interact with the Presto L2 blockchain. These methods include querying account balances, retrieving transaction details, deploying smart contracts, and invoking contract functions. By leveraging the power of JSON-RPC, developers can integrate Presto L2 functionality into their applications, enabling efficient and secure interaction with the blockchain.

Developers can take advantage of zkEVM's privacy and scalability features to build privacy-preserving and high-performance applications on the Presto L2 blockchain. zkEVM uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the confidentiality of transactions and computations, while still maintaining the decentralized nature of the blockchain.

In summary, Presto L2 and Blockchain JSON-RPC provide a powerful combination for developers to build and deploy smart contracts on a decentralized blockchain. With zkEVM as the underlying virtual machine, developers can create privacy-preserving and scalable applications.

To interact with Blockchain JSON-RPC, developers can use various libraries and frameworks. Some popular ones include:

* Web3.js ([How To Use Presto with web3.js](https://www.notion.so/How-To-Use-Presto-with-web3-js-2c1749f74d99448fb59c185eb6c79215?pvs=21)) A JavaScript library that provides a simple and consistent interface for interacting with JSON-RPC based blockchains like Ethereum.
* ethers.js ([How To Use Presto with ethers.js](https://www.notion.so/How-To-Use-Presto-with-ethers-js-76108fc64f5a4481860c7251f34850aa?pvs=21)): Another JavaScript library that offers a complete set of tools and utilities for interacting with JSON-RPC based blockchains.
* [web3.py](http://web3.py/) ([How to use Presto with web3.py](https://www.notion.so/How-to-use-Presto-with-web3-py-d77efab4740646cfa1d4a4a5fed59335?pvs=21)): A Python library that allows developers to interact with JSON-RPC based blockchains using Python code.

These libraries provide convenient abstractions and helper functions to simplify the process of sending requests, handling responses, and working with blockchain data. Developers can choose the library that best suits their programming language and requirements to interact with Blockchain JSON-RPC effectively.
