# Enterprise vs Paid â€”what is the difference?

Presto offers both a paid, self-serve solution for paid rollups as well as enterprise plan.

Paid plans are limited in configuration options (only those that are available through the UI) as well as support and SLAs.

2. End-to-end support with provisioning & guidance when selecting options
3. On-premise solution
4. Custom SLA & Support plans
5. Hosting extra software (backend, frontend, DBs, and smart contracts) directly in the environment
6. Extra development on top of this rollup with one of our partners for end-to-end service
7. Presto-as-API (Rollup-as-a-Service-as-a-Service)
8. Paying with invoices ( advance monthly payments)
9. Custom Rollup Name
