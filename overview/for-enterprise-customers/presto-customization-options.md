***

This document contains the list of the customization options available for enterprise customers of Presto.

There are plenty, but we are also providing a sensible set of defaults for each rollup.

There are multiple type of settings.

* Sections (1) and (2) cover the core rollup settings
* Sections (3), (4) and (5) cover external services.

Section (1) is Hard Settings. These needs to be decided before the rollup is launched.

Some of this options are available for self-serve, when you configure a rollup through Presto UI ([presto.gateway.fm](https://presto.gateway.fm)); others are available at request to the Gateway team.

We are always working to bring more options towards the UI.

## 1. 💎 Hard Settings

#### ⚠️ Decide Before The Chain Launch

Hard settings are _**impossible to change after the rollup had launched**_.

They need to be decided upon before the rollup creation.

### 1.1. 💎 Root Chain / L1

**Available in the Presto UI**: 🟡 partially.

Choose the root chain where proofs and DA (for rollups only) will be settled upon.

**Options**:

* **Ethereum.** ✅ out of the box; 💻 fully automated & available in the UI.
* **Gnosis Chain.** ✅ out of the box; 💻 fully automated & available in the UI.
* **Custom EVM chain. W**e can setup Presto as L2 or L3 on top of any EVM chain that supports necessary opcodes (that excludes some zkEVMs is possible on most L2s like OP or ARB). 👷‍♂️ manual; needs to be discussed with Gateway.

### 1.2. 💎 Data Availability

💟 **CDK feature**

**Available in the Presto UI**: 🟡 partially.

Choose the data availability options for Presto Rollups.

**Options**:

* _**Rollup**_: publish all transactional data into rootchain/L1, recovery from just L1 is possible. The most expensive and secure option. 👷‍♂️ manual; needs to be discussed with Gateway.
* _**Validium**_, _**Local DA:**_ store all transactional data in L2 nodes, don’t publish to L1, the cheapest option, no transaction backup. Also the most private one. ✅ out of the box; 💻 fully automated & available in the UI.
* **Validium, Celestia**: store all transactional data to Celestia nodes, don’t publish to L1, the recovery is possible through L1 and Celestia. Good compromise for price vs security. 👷‍♂️ manual; needs to be discussed with Gateway.

### 1.3. 💎 Gas Token

💟 **CDK feature**

**Available in the Presto UI**: 🟡 partially.

Select which token to use to pay for Gas in L2. This technically means, which token will be linked to the gas token in the rollup bridge.

**Options:**

* _**Default Gas Token.**_ ✅ out of the box; 💻 fully automated & available in the UI. \*\*\*\*\*\*use the same gas token as the rootchain/L1: for Ethereum it will be ETH; for Gnosis Chain xDai, etc.
* **Custom Gas Token** 👷‍♂️ manual; needs to be discussed with Gateway. \*\*\*\*Select any ERC20 token on L1 to serve as a gas token for L2. This also means that costs of L1 transactions for DA and Proofs are fully covered by the rollup operator.

### 1.4. 💎 Gas Fees

💟 **CDK feature**

**Available in the Presto UI**: 🟡 partially.

Select how the fees market will work on the L2.

**Options**:

* **Default Fee Market.** ✅ out of the box; 💻 fully automated & available in the UI. All users pay full gas prices.
* **Fully Gasless.** ✅ out of the box; 💻 fully automated & available in the UI. All users not paying for gas; Costs of L1 transactions for DA and Proofs are fully covered by the rollup owner.
* **Subsidized %%.** 👷‍♂️ manual; needs to be discussed with Gateway. \*\*\*\*Customer pays only a certain %% of the fees. Costs of L1 transactions for DA and Proofs are partially covered by the rollup owner. The exact %% of subsidization doesn’t have to be decided before launch, see (2.2).
* **Gasless For Specific Addresses.** 👷‍♂️ manual; needs to be discussed with Gateway. \*\*\*\*Pre-Selected list of addresses aren’t charged for gas. That is for both transactions **from** an address and transactions **to** an address. The list of addresses doesn’t have to be decided here, see (2.7) for details.

### 1.5. 💎 Genesis Token Distribution

**Available in the Presto UI**: 🔴 no.

How many gas tokens to pre-mint on Genesis of the L2 and to which addresses to assign.

👷‍♂️ manual; needs to be discussed with Gateway.

## 2. Soft Settings

#### ✅ Can be changed at any time

Soft settings could be changed after the rollup had launched, basically at any time. Sometimes it could require some downtime, sometimes — not.

### 2.1. Region / Cloud

_NB! **Migration between regions/clouds** is always 👷‍♂️ manual; needs to be discussed with Gateway._

Changing the region after the chain is launched could lead to downtime!

### 2.2. Gas Fee Subsidization %%

💟 **CDK feature**

**Available in the Presto UI**: 🔴 no. 👷‍♂️ manual; needs to be discussed with Gateway.

Defines how many %% of the gas price is paid by they user vs subsidized by the sequencer.

### 2.3. Frequency of DA and Proofs

💟 **CDK feature**

**Available in the Presto UI**: 🔴 no. 👷‍♂️ manual; needs to be discussed with Gateway.

How often will transactions with DA and proofs be sent to the rootchain.

DA should be settled more often than Proofs!

Making more frequent settlements lead to making the operational cost more expensive, but the bridge will do transactions faster.

Slowing down settlements will lead to a slower bridge, but lower overall operational costs.

For highly

_NB! If all txs are proven and there are no activity — proof will not be generated._

Defaults: DA — max 10 min; proof — up to 1 hour.
