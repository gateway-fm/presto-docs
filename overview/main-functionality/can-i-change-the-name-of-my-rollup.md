# Can I Change The Name of My Rollup?

## Enterprise Customer

If you are an [Enteprise Customer](../for-enterprise-customers/enterprise-onboarding.md) â€” yes, you can ask `support+presto@gateway.fm` to change your name.

## Trial / Paid Customers

Otherwise, the name is auto-generated. You can try to delete and re-create a rollup a few times to make sure you are happy with your name.

**Why?**

The implementation of this measure is driven by a strong focus on security and the prevention of fraudulent activities. By disallowing the use of similar names for rollups, we effectively mitigate the risk of scams and protect your customers from potential deception.

This security measure ensures that your customers can confidently interact with your rollups without being tricked or misled by imposters. It serves as a safeguard against malicious actors attempting to exploit similarities in rollup names for their own nefarious purposes.

## Future Plans

We will offer **linking your own domain** to Presto later. Keep in touch on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gateway\_eth) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3Edt7BCKyv).
