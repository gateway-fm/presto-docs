# How to use a Block Explorer

Each Layer 2 (L2) on Presto comes with a pre-bundled block explorer, which is a powerful tool used to explore and analyze blockchain data. Here are the steps to effectively use a block explorer:

1. Open the block explorer: Start by navigating to a reliable block explorer website. There are various block explorers available for different blockchain networks.
2. Enter the transaction or block hash: Once on the block explorer website, locate the search bar. Enter the transaction hash or block hash of the transaction or block you want to explore.
3. Explore transaction details: If you entered a transaction hash, the block explorer will display detailed information about that particular transaction. You can view the sender and recipient addresses, the transaction amount, transaction fees, and the confirmation status.
4. Analyze block information: If you entered a block hash, the block explorer will provide information about the entire block. You can see the list of transactions included in the block, the block height, block timestamp, and other relevant details.
5. Navigate through the blockchain: Block explorers usually allow you to navigate through the blockchain by providing links to previous and next blocks. This allows you to explore the entire transaction history of the blockchain network.
6. Check wallet balances: Some block explorers also offer the functionality to check the balance of a specific wallet address. This can be useful for verifying the funds in a particular address.

Remember to use a reliable and reputable block explorer to ensure accurate and trustworthy information. Block explorers are valuable tools that provide transparency and visibility into blockchain transactions and blocks.
